Size-dependent migration trade-offs in seasonal environments

This repository contains the Octave codes (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) to plot Figures 2 and 3 of the ms "Size-dependent migration trade-offs in seasonal environments." Basis for future inference of the effect of differential migration on diversity and diversification in dendritic networks -- large datasets of individual migration across many ecosystems.

TODO 
#Improve readme and soul of codes 
#Julia implementation for larger datasets
#Extend code to dendritic networks
