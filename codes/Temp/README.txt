#Smooth T data to find crossing points for cold and warm streams + lake (check figure) :: DynamicsV2Paper.pdf figure
#Highlight the hot and cold stream crossing points 



#Observed migration day with normalized mean stream T :: Run +++ simulated data using broad initial parameter ranges: DO we get the observed decay?
#Fix P in stream and lake
